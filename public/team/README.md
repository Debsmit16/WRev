# Team Profile Pictures

## Why Can't We Auto-Fetch from LinkedIn?

LinkedIn has strict privacy and security policies that prevent automated scraping of profile pictures. This protects user privacy and prevents unauthorized use of personal photos.

## Instructions for Adding Profile Pictures

To add profile pictures for the team members, please **manually** add the following image files to this directory:

### Required Files:
- `debsmit-ghosh.jpg` - Debsmit Ghosh (Project Lead)
- `anuksha-ganguly.jpg` - Anuksha Ganguly (Technical Lead)
- `ujan-das.jpg` - Ujan Das (Full-Stack Developer)
- `ayushman-das.jpg` - Ayushman Das (Hardware Engineer)
- `sobhan-roy.jpg` - Sobhan Roy (Data Scientist)

### Image Requirements:
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: 400x400 pixels (square)
- **Quality**: High resolution, professional headshots
- **Background**: Clean, preferably solid color or professional setting

### How to Add Images:
1. **Ask each team member** to provide their professional photo
2. **Download/save** the photos they provide
3. **Resize to 400x400 pixels** using any image editor
4. **Save with exact filenames** listed above
5. **Place in the `/public/team/` directory**

### Alternative Options:
- Use professional photos taken specifically for the team
- Use photos from other sources (with permission)
- Keep the current initial-based placeholders
- Use generic avatar images

### Current Status:
Currently using attractive gradient placeholders with initials. These look professional and can be kept if photos aren't available.
